## GH Code Search

A chrome extension. This helps you when you wanna find code written in specific language.

### Motivation

Reading the code is very informative as you know. When I learn new programming language, I frequently search code written in the language on Github.

But it is so tiresome for me to configure `Written in this language` in `Advanced search` because the selectbox contains many many many languages. So I made this extension to search quickly.

### Install

Now this haven't released on Chrome Web Store. Clone and install manuallu if you'd like to use.
